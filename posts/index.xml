&lt;p>Up 26 floors, our apartment turns out to be much bigger than expected and pretty nice! &lt;img alt="apartment view" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/view.jpeg">
The view is great, we can see the Hudson from our living room!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were able to get everything unpacked this morning and had plenty of closet space to spare. &lt;img alt="closet" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/closet.jpeg">
I figure it will probably be filled out by the end of the summer with hot new fashion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We got in pretty late, but just in time to meet Sarah for some noodles! We went to Xi&amp;rsquo;an Famous Foods (rather Sarah got takeout) which was good, but a little one-note. Pretty cheap though! I had the cumin lamb noodles which were too lamb-y for Syd and Sarah. Syd got some stewed beef noodles. Better than a kick in the crotch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Entering the Arena</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because of the recent Newark incidents, Syd and I decided to fly into LGA instead. What&amp;rsquo;s the overunder on how long it takes to get from LGA to midtown? I say an hour. And Uber price? $100. No prizes for the winner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to the airport way too early so we got a beer at &lt;em>Chilji&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em> (sorry, Dad).

There is nothing better than an airport beer. You have no place else to be.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
