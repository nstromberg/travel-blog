&lt;p>We love train! Our starting point to catch the train to New Haven (which comes every 30 minutes) was Grand Central Station. It was super easy to get from the subway to the MetroNorth train line, although we allllmost got off track to try an oyster bar we spotted in the station. Chilling on the train and watching the landscape go from packed city streets to neighborhoods with gardens to vast grassy marshes was a fantastic decompression.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Semma</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/semma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 17:31:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/semma/</guid><description>&lt;p>NYT #1! Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it stacks up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nathans-take">Nathan&amp;rsquo;s Take&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yum. Way different from any other Indian food I&amp;rsquo;ve had. Lots of black pepper and cardamom. The dosa was big, fermented, and filled with lentils! Nothing better.
&lt;img alt="dosa" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/semma/dosa.jpeg">
The drink selection was fun, they had several collab beers with the brewery down the street which were all very good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall I thought it was delicious and exciting, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s the best restaurant in NYC. I preferred &lt;a href="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/mam">Mam&lt;/a> but this was still fantastic!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anniversary Dinner</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/dirt_candy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/dirt_candy/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s our anniversary dinner! I chose, mostly because Sydney doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to choose, but partially because I really wanted to go here.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I love tasting menus, but they never fill me up. This was no different, but what a fun experience!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all vegetarian which is hard to come by in tasting menus. I opted for the wine pairing which was only $55 and absolutely worth it. So many funky, fun wines!
The food was incredible, every bite was different and was presented in a unique way. Spring pea curry puffs, carrot falafel in a carrot pita, caesar salad sorbet, everything was amazing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mắm</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/mam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/mam/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mắm is a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant that Sarah recommended. We went with her and let her guide us!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img alt="food" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/mam/food.JPG">
We got quite a spread! Raw razor clams, snail and pork meatballs, whole fried shrimp, and a vegetarian main that was a sort of make-your-own lettuce wraps! The star of the show was the sauce, every dish had a unique sauce that was spicy, sour, salty, fishy, DELICIOUS. My favorite was the snail meatball sreved in the shell. I&amp;rsquo;d never had river snail before, but it was great! Pretty mild, but mixed with lemongrass and chilis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Week</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-week/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 14:50:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-week/</guid><description>&lt;p>We survived the first week!! It was mostly work (onboarding for me and actual work for Sydney), but we tried to do stuff most days!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday">Monday&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First day of work for me. Was a bit stressed about the subway being packed and making my connection, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad at all! Work was mostly introductions and icebreakers. Nothing crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went to a seafood boil (&lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9opPji6VVRogVWct9">Aqua Boil&lt;/a>) with Sarah and her friend Julien. The food was great, but kinda expensive. Welcome to the city! &lt;img alt="aqua boil" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-week/seafood.jpeg">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving on Up</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/day-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/day-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got a few requests for more apartment pics, so here ya go!
&lt;img alt="windows" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/day-2/windows.jpeg">
It&amp;rsquo;s really spacious for NYC!

&lt;h3 id="grocery-shopping">Grocery Shopping&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We did our first grocery shopping adventure! We quickly found out that carts can carry more than our arms, but we still got most of the important things we needed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bread&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avocados&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Salt &amp;amp; Pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pickles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="exploring-the-highline">Exploring the Highline&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We took a walk on the Highline, which is an old railroad path in Chelsea. It was full of plants, but also full of people.

&lt;p>Up 26 floors, our apartment turns out to be much bigger than expected and pretty nice! &lt;img alt="apartment view" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/view.jpeg">
The view is great, we can see the Hudson from our living room!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were able to get everything unpacked this morning and had plenty of closet space to spare. &lt;img alt="closet" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/closet.jpeg">
I figure it will probably be filled out by the end of the summer with hot new fashion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="first-evening">First Evening&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We got in pretty late, but just in time to meet Sarah for some noodles! We went to Xi&amp;rsquo;an Famous Foods (rather Sarah got takeout) which was good, but a little one-note. Pretty cheap though! I had the cumin lamb noodles which were too lamb-y for Syd and Sarah. Syd got some stewed beef noodles. Better than a kick in the crotch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Entering the Arena</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because of the recent Newark incidents, Syd and I decided to fly into LGA instead. What&amp;rsquo;s the overunder on how long it takes to get from LGA to midtown? I say an hour. And Uber price? $100. No prizes for the winner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to the airport way too early so we got a beer at &lt;em>Chilji&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em> (sorry, Dad).
&lt;img alt="syd" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/beer.jpeg">
There is nothing better than an airport beer. You have no place else to be.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
