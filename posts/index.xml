It was mostly work (onboarding for me and actual work for Sydney), but we tried to do stuff most days!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="monday">Monday&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First day of work for me. Was a bit stressed about the subway being packed and making my connection, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad at all! Work was mostly introductions and icebreakers. Nothing crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We went to a seafood boil (&lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9opPji6VVRogVWct9">Aqua Boil&lt;/a>) with Sarah and her friend Julien. The food was great, but kinda expensive. Welcome to the city! &lt;img alt="aqua boil" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-week/seafood.jpeg">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving on Up</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/day-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/day-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got a few requests for more apartment pics, so here ya go!

It&amp;rsquo;s really spacious for NYC!

&lt;h3 id="grocery-shopping">Grocery Shopping&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We did our first grocery shopping adventure! We quickly found out that carts can carry more than our arms, but we still got most of the important things we needed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bread&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avocados&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Salt &amp;amp; Pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pickles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="exploring-the-highline">Exploring the Highline&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We took a walk on the Highline, which is an old railroad path in Chelsea. It was full of plants, but also full of people.

&lt;p>Up 26 floors, our apartment turns out to be much bigger than expected and pretty nice! &lt;img alt="apartment view" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/view.jpeg">
The view is great, we can see the Hudson from our living room!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were able to get everything unpacked this morning and had plenty of closet space to spare. &lt;img alt="closet" loading="lazy" src="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/closet.jpeg">
I figure it will probably be filled out by the end of the summer with hot new fashion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="first-evening">First Evening&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We got in pretty late, but just in time to meet Sarah for some noodles! We went to Xi&amp;rsquo;an Famous Foods (rather Sarah got takeout) which was good, but a little one-note. Pretty cheap though! I had the cumin lamb noodles which were too lamb-y for Syd and Sarah. Syd got some stewed beef noodles. Better than a kick in the crotch!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Entering the Arena</title><link>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because of the recent Newark incidents, Syd and I decided to fly into LGA instead. What&amp;rsquo;s the overunder on how long it takes to get from LGA to midtown? I say an hour. And Uber price? $100. No prizes for the winner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We got to the airport way too early so we got a beer at &lt;em>Chilji&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em> (sorry, Dad).

There is nothing better than an airport beer. You have no place else to be.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
