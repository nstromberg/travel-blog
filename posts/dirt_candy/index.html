Nathan&rsquo;s Take
Dirt Candy
I love tasting menus, but they never fill me up. This was no different, but what a fun experience!
It&rsquo;s all vegetarian which is hard to come by in tasting menus. I opted for the wine pairing which was only $55 and absolutely worth it. So many funky, fun wines!
The food was incredible, every bite was different and was presented in a unique way. Spring pea curry puffs, carrot falafel in a carrot pita, caesar salad sorbet, everything was amazing."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/dirt_candy/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/travel-blog/assets/css/stylesheet.3b937a3a1fb95cf3453faf6f6996d68fea8f8f71ab4fcb40ab2beb1f6b054d9c.css integrity="sha256-O5N6Oh+5XPNFP69vaZbWj+qPj3GrT8tAqyvrH2sFTZw=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/dirt_candy/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/dirt_candy/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nathan and Syd Do NYC"><meta property="og:title" content="Anniversary Dinner"><meta property="og:description" content="It’s our anniversary dinner!
