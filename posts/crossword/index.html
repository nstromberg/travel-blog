Sydney and I have made a habit (2 weeks running) of getting the Sunday Times physically which, for $6, gets you the magazine and a whole bunch of stories I already read on the toilet. But the best part is without a doubt the crossword puzzle.
Yes, I could do the crossword on my phone, but something about physically writing in answers and erasing mistakes makes the process feel more playful.

It&rsquo;s slow, it&rsquo;s cumbersome, and it&rsquo;s infuriating not to know how long it took me, and I love it.

We have done the crossword sitting at an oyster bar, on our dining room table, and at breweries. We&rsquo;ve worked it alone in our spare time, we&rsquo;ve had 4 people working at once. It reminds me of doing super-sized holiday crosswords when we are home for Thanksgiving or Christmas. Having another brain (or four) to help you get unstuck is the best type of connection.
