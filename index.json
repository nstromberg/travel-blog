I chose, mostly because Sydney doesn\u0026rsquo;t like to choose, but partially because I really wanted to go here.\nNathan\u0026rsquo;s Take Dirt Candy I love tasting menus, but they never fill me up. This was no different, but what a fun experience!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all vegetarian which is hard to come by in tasting menus. I opted for the wine pairing which was only $55 and absolutely worth it. So many funky, fun wines! The food was incredible, every bite was different and was presented in a unique way. Spring pea curry puffs, carrot falafel in a carrot pita, caesar salad sorbet, everything was amazing.\nThere were lots of \u0026ldquo;kitchen\u0026rdquo; treats too, which were off menu dishes that were being tested for the next menu. One of my favorites was a cucumber aguachile served in a tiny martini glass. Mace Speaking of tiny martini glasses, we went to Mace which was recommended by a friend, and boy do they have some weird cocktails. And that\u0026rsquo;s coming from me. But everything we tried was great! I had the mace cocktail which featured, you guessed it, mace! Not sure I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had a mace cocktail. Actually, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I haven\u0026rsquo;t.\nI liked that all the cocktails featured a different central ingredient and really played that up with tinctures and liqeurs. Syd\u0026rsquo;s Take I freakin loved this place. Everything had a taste of something new and something familiar - a comfortable amount of boundary-pushing for me. It solidified my opinion that more savory beverage options should exist in the world (I could chug the cucumber aquachile). And that carrots are a bomb.com vegetable.\nSuper great price (this strongly competes with our first anniversary dinner that was waaay more expensive) and the staff was very-down-earth and obviously passionate about food - it was giving Kuntz-family dinner.\nMace was good and had so many fun options!! I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of 75% of the ingredients that were in these things but let them cook forreal. Only vibe-killer was that we were seated in the back room corner away from everyone else in there and I felt like I was in trouble lol.\n","permalink":"https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/dirt_candy/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s our anniversary dinner!

We went with her and let her guide us!\nNathan\u0026rsquo;s Take Food We got quite a spread! Raw razor clams, snail and pork meatballs, whole fried shrimp, and a vegetarian main that was a sort of make-your-own lettuce wraps! The star of the show was the sauce, every dish had a unique sauce that was spicy, sour, salty, fishy, DELICIOUS. My favorite was the snail meatball sreved in the shell. I\u0026rsquo;d never had river snail before, but it was great! Pretty mild, but mixed with lemongrass and chilis.\nAmbiance Plastic stools and metal tables, quick and friendly service, and a tiny bathroom. It was everything I could ever want.\nSydney\u0026rsquo;s Take I measure how much I like a restaurant by 1) how much of the menu I would order if I had unlimited money and unlimited stomach and 2) how much I liked of what I ended up ordering. To address 1, it was hard to select only a few things from the menu - everything on there I wanted - so I already want to go back to try the other items. Regarding 2), wowee. Each dish was so different than the others. Crunchy, springy, salty, fishy, funky, sour, spicy, gelantinous, silky. It was what I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted more of from the Pho and eggroll bowls I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the past from Vietnamese restaurants.

It was mostly work (onboarding for me and actual work for Sydney), but we tried to do stuff most days!\nMonday First day of work for me. Was a bit stressed about the subway being packed and making my connection, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad at all! Work was mostly introductions and icebreakers. Nothing crazy.\nWe went to a seafood boil (Aqua Boil) with Sarah and her friend Julien. The food was great, but kinda expensive. Welcome to the city! Everyone came over to ours after and we watched Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, which is an absolutely insane show.\nTuesday Still just onboarding at work, but at least I\u0026rsquo;m getting free food!\nSydney and I checked out Beer Culture which had lots of good beers and surprisingly good (and cheap) brats. I ate some of Sydney\u0026rsquo;s dregs. Wednesday First day of real work for me! Met my manager, was reading some papers, and met with my team.\nFirst game of the Stanley Cup finals!! We went to the Canuck which was BUSY, even though we got there an hour early! Standing room only! We stayed for the first period and then got some pizza (Vitos) and watched the rest at home! Go Oilers! Thursday Long day at work today, but it was productive!\nFirst actual meal we\u0026rsquo;ve cooked in our petite little kitchen! Stir fried some broccoli and tofu which turned out pretty good! We realized we needed some more cooking utensils though so we bought some mixing bowls and baking sheets. Went on a walk to find ice cream and settled on Ben and Jerry\u0026rsquo;s which was fine! There doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be much in the way of local ice cream places, at least not up by us.\nFriday WFH day for me! The whole company is WFH on Fridays, and we are supposed to be in 3 of the other 4 days. I think Mondays will probably be my other day WFH unless I need to go in for something.\nThe Whitney was free tonight (like every Friday), so Syd and I went with Sarah and Seth to check it out! I was hoping to see some Edward Hopper, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any on display!! Oh well, next time. It was not really stuff I normally like, but it was fun to go and people-watch more than anything. We also met up with Sarah\u0026rsquo;s roommate\u0026rsquo;s high-school friends at ABC Beer Co which was a really cool spot! They had all sorts of beers and some good looking hotdogs too (not confirmed). Getting back was a bit of a headache, but we made it! Bummer that the Oilers lost in OT2! But fun game.\nSaturday Slow start for me after a few beers! Enjoyed my coffee and some leftover halal cart food from lunch yesterday. Glad to see Coco clinch the win at Roland Garros!\nWe went to SoHo to check out the Salomon store, and Sydney got some new kicks!\nIt started pouring rain, so we rushed to the subway, but stopped on the way back to get a bagel from Best Bagel which was surprisingly very good!
