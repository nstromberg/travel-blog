[{"content":"Moving in Up 26 floors, our apartment turns out to be much bigger than expected and pretty nice! The view is great, we can see the Hudson from our living room!\nWe were able to get everything unpacked this morning and had plenty of closet space to spare. I figure it will probably be filled out by the end of the summer with hot new fashion.\nFirst Evening We got in pretty late, but just in time to meet Sarah for some noodles! We went to Xi\u0026rsquo;an Famous Foods (rather Sarah got takeout) which was good, but a little one-note. Pretty cheap though! I had the cumin lamb noodles which were too lamb-y for Syd and Sarah. Syd got some stewed beef noodles. Better than a kick in the crotch!\n","permalink":"https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"moving-in\"\u003eMoving in\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp 26 floors, our apartment turns out to be much bigger than expected and pretty nice! \u003cimg alt=\"apartment view\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/view.jpeg\"\u003e\nThe view is great, we can see the Hudson from our living room!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were able to get everything unpacked this morning and had plenty of closet space to spare. \u003cimg alt=\"closet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/travel-blog/posts/moving-in/closet.jpeg\"\u003e\nI figure it will probably be filled out by the end of the summer with hot new fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"first-evening\"\u003eFirst Evening\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got in pretty late, but just in time to meet Sarah for some noodles!

What\u0026rsquo;s the overunder on how long it takes to get from LGA to midtown? I say an hour. And Uber price? $100. No prizes for the winner.\nWe got to the airport way too early so we got a beer at Chilji\u0026rsquo;s (sorry, Dad). There is nothing better than an airport beer. You have no place else to be.\nThe flight was super bumpy which stressed Syd and the cat down the aisle out, but we got some great views of the city! Once we landed it was smooth sailing! We got another great view of the city from the runway. Turns out, I was spot on with my earlier guesses! Uber was 50 minutes and $98 before tip. We were offered gum, which was nice I suppose.\nIn the next post, we will talk about the apartment and big city living.\n","permalink":"https://nstromberg.github.io/travel-blog/posts/first-day/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBecause of the recent Newark incidents, Syd and I decided to fly into LGA instead.
