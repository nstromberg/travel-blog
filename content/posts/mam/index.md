Mắm is a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant that Sarah recommended. We went with her and let her guide us!

## Nathan's Take
### Food
![food](food.jpg)
We got quite a spread! Raw razor clams, snail and pork meatballs, whole fried shrimp, and a vegetarian main that was a sort of make-your-own lettuce wraps! The star of the show was the sauce, every dish had a unique sauce that was spicy, sour, salty, fishy, DELICIOUS. My favorite was the snail meatball sreved in the shell. I'd never had river snail before, but it was great! Pretty mild, but mixed with lemongrass and chilis. 

### Ambiance
Plastic stools and metal tables, quick and friendly service, and a tiny bathroom. It was everything I could ever want. 

## Sydney's Take
I measure how much I like a restaurant by 1) how much of the menu I would order if I had unlimited money and unlimited stomach and 2) how much I liked of what I ended up ordering. To address 1, it was hard to select only a few things from the menu - everything on there I wanted - so I already want to go back to try the other items. Regarding 2), wowee. Each dish was so different than the others. Crunchy, springy, salty, fishy, funky, sour, spicy, gelantinous, silky. It was what I've always wanted more of from the Pho and eggroll bowls I've had in the past from Vietnamese restaurants. A super fun spot that I'd consider a must-visit for NYC!
