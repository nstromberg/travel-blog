### Moving in
Up 26 floors, our apartment turns out to be much bigger than expected and pretty nice! ![apartment view](view.jpeg)
The view is great, we can see the Hudson from our living room! 

We were able to get everything unpacked this morning and had plenty of closet space to spare. ![closet](closet.jpeg)
I figure it will probably be filled out by the end of the summer with hot new fashion.

### First Evening
We got in pretty late, but just in time to meet Sarah for some noodles! We went to Xi'an Famous Foods (rather Sarah got takeout) which was good, but a little one-note. Pretty cheap though! I had the cumin lamb noodles which were too lamb-y for Syd and Sarah. Syd got some stewed beef noodles. Better than a kick in the crotch!
