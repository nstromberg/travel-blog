It's our anniversary dinner! I chose, mostly because Sydney doesn't like to choose, but partially because I really wanted to go here.

## Nathan's Take
### Dirt Candy
I love tasting menus, but they never fill me up. This was no different, but what a fun experience! 

It's all vegetarian which is hard to come by in tasting menus. I opted for the wine pairing which was only $55 and absolutely worth it. So many funky, fun wines!
The food was incredible, every bite was different and was presented in a unique way. Spring pea curry puffs, carrot falafel in a carrot pita, caesar salad sorbet, everything was amazing. 

There were lots of "kitchen" treats too, which were off menu dishes that were being tested for the next menu. One of my favorites was a cucumber aguachile served in a tiny martini glass.

### Mace
Speaking of tiny martini glasses, we went to Mace which was recommended by a friend, and boy do they have some weird cocktails. And that's coming from me. But everything we tried was great! I had the mace cocktail which featured, you guessed it, mace! Not sure I've ever had a mace cocktail. Actually, I'm sure I haven't. 

I liked that all the cocktails featured a different central ingredient and really played that up with tinctures and liqeurs.

## Syd's Take
I freakin loved this place. Everything had a taste of something new and something familiar - a comfortable amount of boundary-pushing for me. It solidified my opinion that more savory beverage options should exist in the world (I could chug the cucumber aquachile). And that carrots are a bomb.com vegetable.

Super great price (this strongly competes with our first anniversary dinner that was waaay more expensive) and the staff was very-down-earth and obviously passionate about food - it was giving Kuntz-family dinner.

Mace was good and had so many fun options!! I don't think I've heard of 75% of the ingredients that were in these things but let them cook forreal. Only vibe-killer was that we were seated in the back room corner away from everyone else in there and I felt like I was in trouble lol.
