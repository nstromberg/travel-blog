### Grocery Shopping
We did our first grocery shopping adventure! We quickly found out that carts can carry more than our arms, but we still got most of the important things we needed:
 - Eggs
 - Bread
 - Avocados
 - Salt & Pepper
 - Pickles

### Exploring the Highline
We took a walk on the Highline, which is an old railroad path in Chelsea. It was full of plants, but also full of people.
