NYT #1! Let's see how it stacks up.

## Nathan's Take
Yum. Way different from any other Indian food I've had. Lots of black pepper and cardamom. The dosa was big, fermented, and filled with lentils! Nothing better.

The drink selection was fun, they had several collab beers with the brewery down the street which were all very good. 

Overall I thought it was delicious and exciting, but I'm not sure it's the best restaurant in NYC. I preferred [Mam](/travel-blog/posts/mam) but this was still fantastic!

## Sydney's Take
