As someone who prides themselves on crossword solve times, this is hard for me to admit: crosswords are more fun with friends.

Sydney and I have made a habit (2 weeks running) of getting the Sunday Times physically which, for $6, gets you the magazine and a whole bunch of stories I already read on the toilet. But the best part is without a doubt the crossword puzzle. 

Yes, I could do the crossword on my phone, but something about physically writing in answers and erasing mistakes makes the process feel more playful. Critically, the larger format invites collaboration in a way that sitting on your phone can't do. It's slow, it's cumbersome, and it's infuriating not to know how long it took me, and I love it.

We have done the crossword sitting at an oyster bar, on our dining room table, and at breweries. We've worked it alone in our spare time, we've had 4 people working at once. It reminds me of doing super-sized holiday crosswords when we are home for Thanksgiving or Christmas. Having another brain (or four) to help you get unstuck is the best type of connection. It feels a bit like jazz, if that doesn't sound too annoying. Everyone is working towards the same goal, everyone gets a chance to shine, everyone works a little differently. There's a give and take that just makes me happy.
